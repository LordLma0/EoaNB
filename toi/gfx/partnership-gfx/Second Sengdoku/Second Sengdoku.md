> Second Sengdoku
Desc: The Second Sengoku is a mod that is set in 1930's Japan. The mod explores an alternate reality in which the Japanese Shogunate won the Boshin War, slowing their ability to compete with the West and eventually resulting in the fall of the Shogunate shortly after the end of the First World War. The American-aligned Japanese Republic founded in its place now finds itself in tatters, exhausted from ideological division and economic exhaustion. Fragmented by opposing pretender governments seeking to usurp the Republic and Western powers focused on molding a new Japan in their image. It seems like Japan has missed their chance of ever becoming a Great Power. But the world is changing, Hitler's Germany and Stalinist Russia have the West's hands tied, the Republic is restabilizing and tensions are rising both locally and globally. Soon the Second Sengoku will come to an end, and when it does, Japan's destiny for the future will become sealed.
