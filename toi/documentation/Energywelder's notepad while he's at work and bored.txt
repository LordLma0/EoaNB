Im giving serious thought to having some sort of limited conflict between the US and UK in ~1859/1860 over several disagreements the
two had in those years. If UK refutes the clayton-bulwer treaty, the US will get pissy, but thats it. But if the british are then
being shitty over the pig war as well, the pro-war faction will be stronger than it was historically. Obviously we would want this
to be a fast war because, y'know, ACW. But in this case we could make it like a 120 day war via mission, where the US has to capture
vancouver island, belize, and the moskito coast. The results of the war could be guatamala gets to keep belize like theyve claimed for 
centuries, moskito goes to its historical owners, and something happens to the borders in Pacific NW. Obviously this would have to be 
artfully crafted so both human players and AI are warned the US would be coming for them. I'm also picturing the US would get to use a 
faction for this war, and leading up to the conflict can recruit the Central American countries most invested in making gains off of britain. 
This limited war would guarantee more involvement by britain in the ACW, like a guarantee the alabama claims goes hot. This would also 
encourage UK players to not go wild on expansion whenever future historical and a-historical content presents such an oppurtunity, because 
now theyre going to be thinking about having to garrison everything.
