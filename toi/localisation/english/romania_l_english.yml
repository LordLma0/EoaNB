With countless wars ruining any chances for the development of a industry, Wallachia based itself on the agriculture, which, while also sometimes destroyed by wars between the Ottomans and Russian was still worth investing in. Still, the Crimean War has caused much more damage than we would have wanted to our agriculture. On the bright side, some of our advisors are proposing that this is the right time to begin to industrialize and modernize Vlach society as a whole."

In 1857, Wallachia now stand on a continental crossroad, between -The Russian Empire, The Austrian Empire and The Ottoman Empire. Wallachia's ambition to unite the romanian people, long divided since the dawn of the 15th centry, is greatly hindered by it's overlord -The Ottoman Empire, always trying to strenghten it's grip on it's balkan holdings, however one by one, they're all slipping away. If Wallachia ever wishes to unite the state of Romania it will have to lick it's wounds and prepare itself and it's people for hopefully the upcoming elections, which shall decide if the divide between the people of Romania shall finally be mended..."
