 ###Ideas 

 LUX_the_coup:0"The Luxembourger coup of 1856"
 LUX_the_coup_desc:0"The Luxembourg Coup of 1856, also called the Putsch of 1856, was a reactionary revision of Luxembourg's constitution on 27 November 1856. Whilst not a true coup d'état or revolution, its detractors dubbed it a 'royal coup', as the reigning Grand Duke of Luxembourg, William III, greatly expanded his powers, and the name has stuck. Aimed at reversing the liberal successes embodied in the 1848 constitution, the major changes enacted by William were undone with the promulgation of a new constitution in 1868, after the Luxembourg Crisis. However, some changes, such as the creation of the Council of State have lasted."
 LUX_bank:0"The International Bank Of Luxemburg"
 LUX_bank_desc:0"Founded In 1856 as a private company, owned by the state, the Banque Internationale à Luxembourg has been able to greatly boost our profits, but it has also been able to assist us in our foreign diplomacy and trade relations with the other powers of Europe like France, England and the Netherlands, the bank can also cover us if we ever have to go in debt, the International Bank of Luxemburg is nothing but a symbol of our economic development and progress."
