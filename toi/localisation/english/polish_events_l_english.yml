Scheibler made large profits after cotton prices in Europe increased because of the American Civil War and sold his stock at triple the price.

This marriage enriches Izrael Poznański’s, a master of „weaving profession” at the time, fortune by a manufacturer worth 500 roubles. He started to work for Karol Scheibler's company in Łódź. However, he was gradually setting out to accomplish his greatest project - the construction of a great factory. From 1871 Poznański began to buy out the land between Ogrodowa, Stodolniana and Podrzeczna Streets. The construction of Poznański’s industrial complex began in the 70s of 19th century. The first building was a weaving mill with a saw-tooth roof, the first of its kind in Łódź.

 ### News Events

 news_poland.1.t: "Polish Insurrection In Russia"
 news_poland.1.d: "After the Poles were defeated in the Russo-Polish War of 1830–31, they lost their semi-independent state and the Congress Kingdom ceased to exist. On its place the Russian administration was set up, which was quite eager to punish Poles for their separatist ambitions. The Russian defeat in the Crimean War has shown Russia’s weaknesses and Poles have taken action. After a few years of scheming, the Polish people have revolted and now a full-fledged national uprising is taking place in the Polish territories in Russia. With competent leadership and a great amount of luck, Poles might regain their independence. Whether it remains a local conflict has yet to be seen, as some European powers might wish to interfere in this conflict."
 news_poland.1.a: "Interesting..."
 news_poland.1.b: "Their puny rebellion will be crushed!"
 news_poland.1.c: "Za Wolność Naszą i Waszą!"

 news_poland.2.t: "Congress Kingdom Restored"
 news_poland.2.d: "What has recently happened in Poland is quite a surprise to everyone. Due to international pressure and somewhat successful actions of the Polish insurgents, the Russian Tsar has decided to restore the Polish Kingdom, the same one which was disbanded over 30 years ago during the reign of his father, Nicholas I. This situation doesn’t quite satisfy the Poles, but it allows them to decide for themselves to some extent."
 news_poland.2.a: "Good for them"
 news_poland.2.b: "This should keep the Poles quiet for some time"
 news_poland.2.c: "Today autonomy, tomorrow independence!"

 news_poland.3.t: "Anti-Russian Coalition Forms"
 news_poland.3.d: "The western states, after seeing the Sisyphus efforts taken by the Polish people, have decided to support them, not only diplomatically, as they have done so far, but also militarily. The United Kingdom has proclaimed the creation of the Anti-Russian Coalition and has invited everyone willing to support Poles in their struggle for independence. It looks like Russia is in a quite dire situation and a repeat of the Crimean War might take place."
 news_poland.3.a: "Interesting..."
 news_poland.3.b: "Oh dear..."
 news_poland.3.c: "Finally, help arrives!"
 news_poland.3.e: "Charge!"

 news_poland.4.t: "Anti-Russian Coalition Defeated"
 news_poland.4.d: "Against all expectations, the tsarist army has managed to repel the coalition’s army and has secured victory in this conflict. While Russia can’t press any demands on the western countries, the same can’t be said about the Polish. Right now many former insurgents and their supporters are being executed or banished to Siberia. The Russian government has already announced increased russification processes in Poland and a complete removal of any autonomy. Looks like it won’t be an easy time for Poles in Russia, especially to those who live outside the region of Congress Kingdom, now called the \"Vistula Country\"."
 news_poland.4.a: "Well, that certainly didn't go as planned..."
 news_poland.4.b: "God Save The Tsar!"

 news_poland.5.t: "Anti-Russian Coalition Victorious"
 news_poland.5.d: "Even though there were some hopes that Russia may succeed to protect its territorial integrity, the tsarist armies have failed to achieve their task and in the end, Russia has surrendered. A new independent Polish state will be restored. Many in Poland are overjoyed and in most cities and villages grand festivals are taking place. Yet, the time for celebration will soon end, as there is still much to do."
 news_poland.5.a: "What else could have happened?"
 news_poland.5.b: "Now, we really need to rethink our strategies"
 news_poland.5.c: "Finally independence..."

 news_poland.6.t: "Royal Election In Poland"

After the restoration of the Polish state, most have voted in favour of monarchy and now, much like in the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, a free election was proclaimed. The Royal Commission has chosen and invited these individuals, which were seen fit for the Polish throne. We already know that Napoléon-Jérôme Bonaparte and Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria were invited to participate in the royal election. Whoever will be chosen, shall impact greatly on European and Polish politics."
