While ingnoring french demands probably wouldn't do us anything bad it would be a quick way to end the uprising, though if we were to ignore the demands about the Alvensleben Convention we might face some kind of a coaltion forming against us."

Scheibler made large profits after cotton prices in Europe increased because of the American Civil War and sold his stock at triple the price.

This marriage enriches Izrael Poznański’s, a master of „weaving profession” at the time, fortune by a manufacturer worth 500 roubles. He started to work for Karol Scheibler's company in Łódź. However, he was gradually setting out to accomplish his greatest project - the construction of a great factory. From 1871 Poznański began to buy out the land between Ogrodowa, Stodolniana and Podrzeczna Streets. The construction of Poznański’s industrial complex began in the 70s of 19th century. The first building was a weaving mill with a saw-tooth roof, the first of its kind in Łódź. In 1872 the factory's first department was set in motion - the weaving mill, equipped with 200 English-made mechanical looms which constituted a technological breakthrough in the textile industry."

 news_poland.1.t:0 "Polish Insurrection In Russia"
 news_poland.1.d:0 "After the Poles were defeated in the Russo-Polish War of 1830–31, they lost their semi-independent state and the Congress Kingdom ceased to exist. On its place the Russian administration was set up, which was quite eager to punish Poles for their separatist ambitions. The Russian defeat in the Crimean War has shown Russia’s weaknesses and Poles have taken action. After a few years of scheming, the Polish people have revolted and now a full-fledged national uprising is taking place in the Polish territories in Russia. With competent leadership and a great amount of luck, Poles might regain their independence. Whether it remains a local conflict has yet to be seen, as some European powers might wish to interfere in this conflict."

 news_poland.2.d:0 "What has recently happened in Poland is quite a surprise to everyone. Due to international pressure and somewhat successful actions of the Polish insurgents, the Russian Tsar has decided to restore the Polish Kingdom, the same one which was disbanded over 30 years ago during the reign of his father, Nicholas I. This situation doesn’t quite satisfy the Poles, but it allows them to decide for themselves to some extent."

The United Kingdom has proclaimed the creation of the Anti-Russian Coalition and has invited everyone willing to support Poles in their struggle for independence. It looks like Russia is in a quite dire situation and a repeat of the Crimean War might take place."

While Russia can’t press any demands on the western countries, the same can’t be said about the Polish. Right now many former insurgents and their supporters are being executed or banished to Siberia. The Russian government has already announced increased russification processes in Poland and a complete removal of any autonomy. Looks like it won’t be an easy time for Poles in Russia, especially to those who live outside the region of Congress Kingdom, now called the \"Vistula Country\"."
