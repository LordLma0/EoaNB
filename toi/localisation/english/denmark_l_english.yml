### FOCUSES/FOCI ###
#Economy/Industry
DEN_focus_danish_economy:0 "Danish Economy"
DEN_focus_danish_economy_desc:0 "Denmark is still a largely agrarian nation, with much of our economy relying on farming. However, if this status quo is allowed to continue our nation will fall behind its neighbors, as well as carrying the risk that if significant changes in the prices of food occur our economy could collapse. To provide our people with the goods, opportunities, and security they require we must begin further industrialization."
DEN_focus_abolition_of_the_sound_toll:0 "The Abolition of the Sound Toll"
DEN_focus_abolition_of_the_sound_toll_desc:0 "The Sound Toll had been an essential part of our government income for centuries, but its effect on our economy was proven to be quite negative. We must bear the weight of this loss in order to improve the strength of our economy and improve our relations with our neighbors and trade partners. With the reasonable compensation we have received for the abolition, we should immediately invest those funds into other projects."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_projects:0 "Infrastructure Projects"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_projects_desc:0 "In order to utilize our industrial buildup in ways which will benefit our citizens, we will modernize our infrastructure. These improvements will allow faster communication, better trade, and increase the ease of travel for goods and people across the nation. Once these improvements have been made, we could even begin work on even more modern initiatives to supplement what we have already constructed."
DEN_focus_aarhus_randers_railway:0 "The Aarhus-Randers Railway Line"
DEN_focus_aarhus_randers_railway_desc:0 "Randers is one of the most prominent cities of Jutland, and is one of the most important centers for the agricultural industry. Aarhus on the other hand has long been a major center for industrial processing of agricultural products, as well as a major trade center. By connecting the two cities we can unite the region closer together, as well as significantly bolstering the economies of both cities."
DEN_focus_fredericia_aarhus_railway:0 "The Fredericia-Aarhus Railway Line"
DEN_focus_fredericia_aarhus_railway_desc:0 "Fredericia has two roles: it acts as a port and as a center for the production of innovative goods and other industries. Due to this, connecting it to the economic powerhouse of Aarhus, which has its own ports and industries, would allow a greater interconnectedness between both of their economies, as well as providing a corridor further south in the kingdom. With this effort we can connect the nation, its goods, and our people."
DEN_focus_lille_syd_railway:0 "The Lille Syd Railway Line"
DEN_focus_lille_syd_railway_desc:0 "While our rail line from Copenhagen to Korsør was completed years ago, further rail lines could help further improve the economy of Zealand. With an additional line that connects to our already constructed rail, we can connect previously neglected areas of Zealand, helping to improve the lives of those living away from the capital and the strength of Copenhagen's position."
DEN_focus_odense_svendborg_railway:0 "The Odense-Svendborg Railway Line"
DEN_focus_odense_svendborg_railway_desc:0 "Odense has found itself as the second largest city of Denmark, and dominates its island of Funen. By connecting Odense to Svendborg in the south we can promote the economy of both cities, as well as helping to interconnect our nation to a greater extent. This effort would solidify the place of Odense, and hopefully improve the lives of people across both the island and our nation."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_bornholm:0 "Improve Infrastructure on Bornholm"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_bornholm_desc:0 "Bornholm is somewhat isolated compared to the rest of Denmark, and while bridges between other islands could be considered, Bornholm can never be connected directly to Zealand. Therefore, to improve the situation for our citizens on Bornholm we must make investments into their local infrastructure with a focus on the development of the region itself, rather than its interconnectedness."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_iceland:0 "Improve Infrastructure on Iceland"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland is distant from our main islands, but has strategic importance and provides useful resources as well as a strong fishing industry. Additional improvements to its infrastructure. These efforts could potentially strengthen the already present economy of the island, and give local and national investors the opportunity for further investment and development of the island."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_faroe_islands:0 "Improve Infrastructure on the Faroe Islands"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_faroe_islands_desc:0 "The Faroe Islands closely border Great Britain, and like most of our other islands rely heavily on their fishing industry. Improving the local infrastructure could provide opportunities to reduce this reliance, and to improve the size and economic capabilities of its ports and cities."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_greenland:0 "Improve Infrastructure in Greenland"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_greenland_desc:0 "Isolated and sparsely populated, Greenland's main value lies in its natural resources and fishing industries. By improving the infrastructure there we can increase our control of the land, as well as give us the opportunity to extract the island's natural riches."
DEN_focus_demographic_development:0 "Demographic Development"
DEN_focus_demographic_development_desc:0 "A massive increase in agricultural output, as well as medical and sanitation improvements across our nation have caused a massive rise in life expectancy and is allowing our nation's population to grow rapidly. Across our nation more of our citizens are surviving childhood, people are having more children and more hands are contributing to our economy."
DEN_focus_copenhagen_sewerage:0 "København Sewerage System"
DEN_focus_copenhagen_sewerage_desc:0 "Establishing a united sewage system for our capital will improve the safety and hygiene of the city greatly. With our current practices, waste can cause diseases to appear and spread, putting our citizens at risk. By removing this issue, Copenhagen can become a city that truly befits the quality of our nation."
DEN_focus_rapid_urbanization:0 "Rapid Urbanization"
DEN_focus_rapid_urbanization_desc:0 "While our economy may still largely rely on agricultural activity, its new industrial scale combined with the opportunities and wealth available in cities has been driving many away from the countryside and into our cities. We must facilitate this growth and help it to continue or increase due to the reliance of our new industrial efforts on a continually expanding workforce."
DEN_focus_improve_public_hygiene:0 "Improve Public Hygiene"
DEN_focus_improve_public_hygiene_desc:0 "While urbanization has consistently grown the size of our cities, the sanitation of our cities has often been unable to keep up. By investing into sanitation works such as sewers we can make our cities far safer for our citizens to live in, and ensure that outbreaks of disease are less dangerous and more contained."
DEN_focus_population_boom:0 "Population Boom"
DEN_focus_population_boom_desc:0 "Changes to hygiene, medical care, and the availability of food have allowed our population to balloon in recent years, granting our nation a great future. While this change can be seen in the size of many of our lesser cities, it is also allowing the population of the villages across the nation to grow, and our greatest cities have seen their populations expand as well."
DEN_focus_industrialization_efforts:0 "Industrialization Efforts"
DEN_focus_industrialization_efforts_desc:0 "To truly keep our economy competitive with our neighbors and on the international scene, a great focus must be placed on industrialization. Much of this effort will have to be focused on the development of agriculture to a greater scale, as well as developing an ability to process the products of our own agriculture. In addition to this our central position as the only way in and out of the Baltic can give our economy a perfect opportunity to process goods from one side of the sea and sell it on the other end."
DEN_focus_hassel_teudt:0 "Hassel & Teudt"
DEN_focus_hassel_teudt_desc:0 "The entrepreneurs J.G. Fridolin Hassel and Ludvig F. Teudt have established a factory in Copenhagen which bears both their names. It produces metal goods and hopefully will represent a great trend of industrialization in our capital, bringing more and more entrepreneurs and businesses to our great city."
DEN_focus_hansen_writing_ball:0 "The Hansen Writing Ball"
DEN_focus_hansen_writing_ball_desc:0 "Writing has remained largely the same since the invention of the printing press. That is, until the reverend Rasmus Malling-Hansen invented his Writing Ball. It allows the user to write using keys pushed inwards rather than with a hand or with a traditional printing press. This revolution in writing will be exported to many who desire it, although it currently is unfortunately still being hand crafted."
DEN_focus_carlsberg_company:0 "Carlsberg-Bryggerier"

DEN_focus_dfds_company:0 "Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab"
DEN_focus_dfds_company_desc:0 "As a nation placed at a crossroad like Denmark is, as well as one with so many ports and such a long coastline, a highly developed shipping industry is only natural. However, much of the strength of the industry is divided. If the three strongest steamship shipping companies were united into one, singular, company our maritime fleets could gain a far stronger position in the Baltic and North Sea."
DEN_focus_dfds_company_effect_tt:0 "§GDFDS can be selected for a company partnership.§!"
DEN_focus_economic_future:0 "Economic Future"
DEN_focus_economic_future_desc:0 "Denmark is a nation at many crossroads. We are the only way in and out of the Baltic Sea, caught with an unhappy alliance with Great Britain, and trying to hold a foot in both the Scandinavian world and the German one. However, we cannot stand on the precipice forever, and eventually a decision must be made. What does the future hold for Denmark and her people?"
DEN_focus_our_future_scandinavia:0 "Our Future Lies in Scandinavia"
DEN_focus_our_future_scandinavia_desc:0 "Although our history with our Scandinavian neighbors has often been violent and our rivalries are long established, our mutual histories and proximities bring us closer than our history can tear us apart. While our relations with other European nations can be fickle, establishing close cooperation with our neighbors can establish the stability that our nation needs to be able to thrive moving forward."
DEN_focus_found_the_danske_bank:0 "Den Danske Landmandsbank"
DEN_focus_found_the_danske_bank_desc:0 "While Denmark already has a national bank, the establishment of a commercial bank, particularly one which is focused on our farmers can significantly benefit our economy, providing funds for the expansion of industries, and the development of new ones. The additional development of banks within our nation can provide the funds required for our planned industrial expansion."
DEN_focus_scandinavian_monetary_union:0 "The Scandinavian Monetary Union"
DEN_focus_scandinavian_monetary_union_desc:0 "With our alignment towards our Scandinavian neighbors, a monetary union would only be natural. By tying our economy and currency to our neighbors we can bring great benefits to our own nation, as well as our neighbors, and ensure that all trade is conducted fairly and easily. This greater integration will help to make the ties our nations have shared practical as well as political and cultural."
DEN_focus_scandinavian_monetary_union_trigger_tt:0 "§YThe third preliminary meeting for the Scandinavian Monetary Union has taken place in Copenhagen.§!"
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_krone:0 "Replace the Rigsdaler with the Krone"
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_krone_desc:0 "In order to better integrate our economy with our Scandinavian brothers, we must abandon our old Rigsdaler. Instead, we will adopt the Krone and bring ourselves closer to our neighbors. This monetary union will unite our economies and our commerce together, and promote unity politically at the same time."
DEN_focus_our_future_germany:0 "Our Future Lies in Germany"
DEN_focus_our_future_germany_desc:0 "Denmark has had half a step in Germany on and off for almost a millennium. Even today, Holstein and Schleswig tie us to our southern neighbors. While many expect us to align with our Scandinavian neighbors, the growing might of Prussia and other German nations could offer us an alternate future."
DEN_focus_join_the_zollverein:0 "Ask to Join the Zollverein"
DEN_focus_join_the_zollverein_desc:0 "Few consider Denmark to be a “German” nation, but we certainly have deep ties to the Germans in both our history and in the present. In light of this, we could request to join the Zollverein. Our addition to the Zollverein would strengthen both sides' economies, all it requires is that the Germans will allow our induction."
DEN_focus_dano_german_monetary_union:0 "The Dano-German Monetary Union"
DEN_focus_dano_german_monetary_union_desc:0 "We have already aligned our economy with Germany, and taking steps to make our economies even more integrated and trade more streamlined will benefit us greatly. To this end, we will enter a monetary union with our southern neighbor, tying us together even further."
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_mark:0 "Replace the Rigsdaler with the Mark"
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_mark_desc:0 "With our alignment with Germany, we will officially abandon the Rigsdaler, and instead replace it with the German Mark. This move will help to unite our economy with the might of our southern neighbor."
DEN_focus_second_industrial_revolution:0 "The Second Industrial Revolution"
DEN_focus_second_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "While the first industrial revolution brought massive changes to our economy, many of the changes were sequestered away or only shocking in their scale and efficiency. Today, the changes technology brings are creating never before seen wonders that will change the lives of those across both Denmark, and Europe. Rail lines criss-crossing the entire nation, great ships of steel, and even more wonders yet unseen are being built, and our nation will benefit from them all!"

#Country Leader Descriptions
DEN_CARL_CHRISTOFFER_GEORG_ANDRAE_LEADER_DESC:0 "Carl Christopher Georg Andræ is the President of Denmark and the leader of the Cabinet of Andræ. From 1842 until 1854, he was a professor of mathematics and mechanics at the national military college. During his tenure as professor, he was royally appointed as a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly, and six years later, became Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Bang. He was appointed President of Denmark in 1856 but although he was trying to appease both the left and the right, his reign unfortunately hasn't been one of peace and calm, as tensions continue to rise in Schleswig and Holstein even after the conclusion of the First Schleswig War. Due to the tiring political turf war, his days as president seem numbered, and it has become semi-public knowledge within political circles that Andræ is considering retirement from his position."
DEN_CARL_CHRISTIAN_HALL_LEADER_DESC:0 "Carl Christian Hall is a Danish national liberal statesman. He had a distinguished tenure at school and college, after which he became a professor of law. His first steps in politics was when Hall had taken office in the Bang administration on the 12th of December 1854. He's since grown quite a reputation as a politician and, as of now, he has been appointed President of Denmark. With rising tensions around the Schleswig-Holstein question, Hall has been a strong supporter of the Ejderpolitikken policy, which aims to restore Denmark's historic southern border on the Eider river, which runs between Schleswig and Holstein. Hall shares this belief with most of the national liberals, who aim to tie the Duchy of Schleswig more firmly to Denmark, even if it means confrontation with the German Confederation."
DEN_CHRISTIAN_EMIL_FRIJS_LEADER_DESC:0 "Christian Emil Frijs is a Danish politician that is currently the President of Denmark, heading the Frijs Cabinet. He graduated from Sorø Academy in 1835, going on to study law. He is the wealthiest large squire of Denmark and is honored by his peasants. He is part of the Højre, also known as the Conservative Party and is actively against the National Liberals. Noticing the tensions around Schleswig-Holstein, Frijs so far has decided to oppose the Ejderpolitikken policy in favor of maintaining the status-quo."

Holstein is the part that harbors the German population in Schleswig-Holstein, leading to a conflict with the Danish-populated Schleswig, which Denmark wants to align to Denmark proper, but cannot because of the London Protocol, which forbids any split of the Duchy. The German population in Schleswig-Holstein is also interesting for the German Confederation, in which various factions want to integrate those German-speaking parts into it, again, leading to conflict with Denmark, which also has claims on our region. This complicated situation means that tensions between the Germans and Denmark are tense and could escalate any second..."

SCH_idea_ethnic_conflicts_DEN_desc:0 "The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein consists of the two parts Schleswig and Holstein. Schleswig is the part that is populated by the Danish, which results in the Danish attempts of integrating Schleswig into the Danish state. Unfortunately, the London Protocol, which drew the war in Schleswig-Holstein to a close in 1852, forbid Denmark to take such steps again, stating that Schleswig and it's German-speaking counterpart, Holstein are inseperable and shall be only ruled seperately from Denmark proper. Only time may tell if Denmark is willing to follow the regulations set by the London Protocol or if they will want to pursue the path of integrating Schleswig into Denmark..." 
DEN_SCH_no_request_forces:0 "Due to the limitations of the §YLondon Protocol of 1852§!, Denmark is not allowed to request forces from Schleswig and Holstein, as the duchies have to be administered as a separate entity outside §Y[DEN.GetNameDef]§!."
