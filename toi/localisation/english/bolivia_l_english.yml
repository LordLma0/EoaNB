Considering the government unconstitutional, many revolts sprouted but were easily stopped. After a number of small battles, the ill-trained Constitutionalist army fled and met with Belzú, who declared a revolution, uniting over 1,000 armed men in Sucre. The two vanguards met in La Paz, with the rebels being pushed back, but reorganizing, with most of Potosi falling under the rebels and even Tarija, with Constitutionalists Alejo and Cirilo beginning a struggle to take Cochabamba."
