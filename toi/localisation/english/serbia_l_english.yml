After the Principality of Serbia was formally established, there were many different foreign coins in circulation. Eventually, Prince Miloš Obrenović decided to introduce some order by establishing exchange rates based on the groat as money of account. In 1819 Miloš published a table rating 43 different foreign coins, 10 gold, 28 silver, and 5 copper. After the last Ottoman garrisons were withdrawn in 1867, Serbia was faced with multiple currencies in circulation. Thus, the prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency to be minted. In 1868, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 paras.
