 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union:0 "Swedish-Norwegian Union"
 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union_desc:0 "Kielfreden was concluded on January 14, 1814 between Sweden and Denmark. It was forced by the Swedish heir to the throne Karl Johan, who was commander-in-chief of the Allied Northern Army in the war against Napoleon I. After the battle of Leipzig in 1813, he returned with his army to Denmark. According to the peace treaty in Kiel, the Danish king was to cede Norway to the king of Sweden, while Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania and Rügen to Denmark, as well as paying one million riksdaler to Denmark. According to the first draft of the peace treaty, the whole of Norway would be transferred to Sweden, but in the final treaty, the Norwegian colonies of Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands were excluded, which now instead became Danish. This, that Norway would be part of what they called a forced union with Sweden and also lose their colonies, caused great anger among many in Norway.\nOn May 17, 1814, the Norwegian constitution (based on Montesquieu's doctrine of the division of power) was adopted in Eidsvoll. After that, the elected assembly then elected the Danish Crown Prince Kristian Fredrik (later Kristian VIII of Denmark) as Norwegian king, but without foreign support, the new regime could not in the long run stand up to Karl Johan's demands for the fulfillment of the Kiel Treaty, and after a short military intervention had to give way. At the Convention in Moss on 14 August, a ceasefire was concluded, and King Kristian Fredrik agreed to an abdication so Norway would be allowed to keep its constitution in a personal union with Sweden. He abdicated and left the country on October 10 after handing over government power to the Storting.\nOn November 4, 1814, the Norwegian Storting and the Swedish negotiators agreed on the terms, and a revised Norwegian constitution was adopted and Charles XIII (in Norway Charles II) was elected King of Norway. According to the Union Treaty, Norway would be united with Sweden in a union as its own kingdom with its own laws and ordinances but with a common royal house and a common foreign policy led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm."

 NOR_idea_pm_in_stockholm:0 "Norwegian Prime Minister in Stockholm"
 NOR_idea_pm_in_stockholm_desc:0 "The Norwegian Prime Minister in Stockholm is a public official elected by the Swedish king. His job is to relay the requests of the Norwegian government directly to the Swedish king."

 NOR_idea_storting:0 "The Norwegian Storting"
 NOR_idea_storting_desc:0 "The Storting, an institution founded with the 1814 constitution. As the Norwegian parliament, it represents a free Norway without the influence of the Swedish.\nIt is divided into two chambers: the Lagting, the upper house and court of impeachment, and the Odelsting, the lower house and legislative chamber. After an election, 3/4 of the elected representatives join the Odelsting while 1/4 join the Lagting. Because both chambers are filled with representatives from the same election, there are rarely any ideological difference between the two. Therefore, most bills that are sent to the Lagting are mostly approved without any revisions."

 NOR_idea_samis:0 "An Oppressed Ethnic Group"
 NOR_idea_samis_desc:0 "The Samis are a nomadic people living in northern Europe. The territory they live on spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, with the majority of Samis residing within our borders. Their lifestyle is very different from the western-style Norwegian lifestyle seen in the cities, which puts them at odds with the Norwegian settlers, especially when it comes to natural resources. Even though they are mostly peaceful, the Norwegians have shown little mercy towards their culture and people, whom they deem inferior. The land they live on is filled with metals and other natural resources sitting ready for exploitation, and due to a blossoming of nationalist thought, the Samis have been put through a process of assimilation and segregation, as a part of a program called Norwegianization. Unjust or not, this is certainly not showing any signs of stopping, and the future of Sami culture isn't very bright."

 #NOR_idea_state_of_workers:0 "State of the Workers"
 #NOR_idea_state_of_workers_desc:0 "The workers in Norway, like in most countries in the world, work and live in bad conditions. The condition in many of the workplaces are bad, and adding to that, dangerous machines have little to no protection. Workers are also not supplied with safety gear, so a small problem can be quite damaging. If the workers have it too bad, they might radicalize and start to develop dangerous ideas! We should keep them satisfied enough to prevent conflict."

 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten:0 "Embedsmannstaten"
 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten_desc:0 "According to the constitution of 1814, Norway is a democracy with clear seperation of powers and popular sovereignty, although in reality it is much closer to an autocracy. This is because the country is controlled by a powerful ruling class in servitude the Swedish king. The constitution grants the King powers to appoint the Prime Minister of his choice, without any oversight by the parliament or the people. Looking at all of these things together, it is pretty obvious that Norway is a puppet of the Swedish Crown, but only because of the kings influence over Norwegian politics. Although the King is vested with a near absolute amount of power, there exists an organized opposition to Swedish rule. Rural farmers and liberal business owners have been fighting for more self-determination, parliamentary sovereignty over government, and some, even full independence."

 NOR_idea_emigration:0 "Massive Emigration"
 NOR_idea_emigration_desc:0 "Because of high birthrates in Norway, there is often little for the children without any inheritance. The cities has also little to offer with few jobs and low pay. Because of this, a lot of healthy and young Norwegians decide to move to the USA instead of staying in Norway. We need the people, and have to find a solution to this problem."
