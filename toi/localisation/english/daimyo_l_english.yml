 daimyo.1.t: "Hisamitsu retires as regent"
 daimyo.1.d: "Shimazu Hisamitsu, the father of young Tadayoshi, has long served as a regent in the place of the now formerly underage young lord, governing day-to-day affairs and policy until the day that he would be of sufficient age to take the mantle of Daimyo. Today that day has come, and lord-regent Hisamitsu has stood down from his position in favour of his now matured son Tadayoshi. A new lord rules Satsuma Domain!"
 daimyo.1.a: "A new Daimyo rules!"
