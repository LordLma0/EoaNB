bwr.1.t:0 "Military Question"
bwr.1.d:0 "The military fought long and hard against our revolution. Dealing with the military will be first step to ensure the security of the new British state. There are many hardliners who believe we must purge the military completely and not risk a coup in the future. However, this would leave our new armed forces very weak and without experience. Moderates believe we should pardon all the royalist forces and ensure our military remains a formidable force, but this would make a coup easier. There are those in the middle who believe we should arrest influential figures who oppose our new state, this would be a compromise, although is it enough?"
bwr.1.a:0 "Purge the Military"
bwr.1.b:0 "Arrest influential Opposer"
bwr.1.c:0 "Pardon all Royalists"
bwr.2.t:0 "Landowners Question"
bwr.2.d:0 "The landowner of Britain was treating the working class unfairly, as a result we began our great revolution! We were successful and must now decide what to do with landowners. Hardliners believe the state should own all the land and allow the British people to work on the land freely. Centrists suggest we should redistribute land as equally. Finally, Moderates believe we should allow current landowners to keep a little of their land, as they have experience and redistribute the rest of the land."
bwr.2.a:0 "The state should own all the land"
bwr.2.b:0 "Redistribute the land equally"
bwr.2.c:0 "Allow them to keep SOME land"
bwr.3.t:0 "Economy Question"
bwr.3.d:0 "After the revolution the British economy needs to be reformed. Hardliners believe that everyone should be employed by the state. While there are those believe the state should only employ farmers or Industrial workers. While they all have the positives, we must think long term and which will be most beneficial and a low burden on the state."
bwr.3.a:0 "All will be employed by the state"
bwr.3.b:0 "Only Farming will be ran by the state"
bwr.3.c:0 "Only Industry shall be ran by the state"
bwr.4.t:0 "Trade Question"
bwr.4.d:0 "The British Isles has plenty of resources which other nations need. We must decide whether we keep the resources for ourselves or be more Liberal minded and trade across the seas. Both have their pros and cons and will both benefit our reconstruction on different ways."

bwr.4.b:0 "Export surplus resources"
bwr.4.c:0 "Free Trade"
bwr.5.t:0 "Religion Question"
bwr.5.d:0 "Many within our state see religion as a problem and a tool for the upper class to use against us. Hardliners believe we should ban religion and force the nation to Atheists. However, this would make the vast majority in the nation un-happy with us. Centrists believe we should only discourage religion, while this would ensure religion slowly fades away, it isn’t guaranteed. Moderates suggest that we should be more Liberal minded and allow freedom of religion, this would help rebrand Britain for the better. How should we proceed?"
bwr.5.a:0 "Atheism"
bwr.5.b:0 "Discourage religion"
bwr.5.c:0 "Allow freedom of religion"
bwr.6.t:0 "Monarchy Question"

But there is no guarantee we would prevent a coup from occurring."
bwr.6.a:0 "Monarchy Abolished"
bwr.6.b:0 "Monarchy Remains"
bwr.7.t:0 "Monarchy Abolished!"
bwr.7.d:0 "We must now decide what to do with the old royal family. Hardliners believe we should execute them and make examples for those who do nothing for their people. However, this is bound to upset the international community, especially those who have family links to the royals. There are some suggestions to release them as private citizens, while it would allow us to keep an eye on them it could cause issues down the line. Finally, there is the idea to exile the royal family to Canada. But there would not be anything stopping them coming back with a larger army, we would fully be relying on the goodwill of the Queen."
bwr.7.a:0 "Execute the Royals"
bwr.7.b:0 "Force them to remain in Britain"
bwr.7.c:0 "Allow them to go to Canada"
bwr.8.t:0 "Monarchy Remains!"
bwr.8.d:0 "We have decided to keep the royal family. As a result the rest of the British Empire as decided to see our new Government as legitimate. However, this isn't to say many are happy with the situation..."

bwr.9.t:0 "Britain's Future?"
bwr.9.d:0 "With the departure of the Empire, Britain must look to its future! Some believe we should bring back the old Commonwealth, similar to Oliver Cromwell's after the English Civil war. Although, some worry if this would lead to a status-quo and no real change occurring. Some believe Britain should be reformed into a Republic, similar to the Americans. How should we proceed?"
bwr.9.a:0 "Declare the Commonwealth of Britain"
bwr.9.b:0 "The British Republic"
bwr.11.t:0 "Irish Question"
bwr.11.d:0 "With a swift victory in the revolution, we were able to quickly bring order to Ireland. However, the vast population in Ireland do not see us as the legitimate government. We must decide how to handle this delicate situation. Hardliners believe we should spread the revolution into Ireland and make them understand. Centrists suggest we should allow Home Rule. While Centrists say we would be hypocritical to try and hold onto Ireland and that we must release them to determine their own future."
bwr.11.a:0 "Force the BWR to Ireland"
bwr.11.b:0 "Create a friendly government in Ireland"
bwr.11.c:0 "Allow Ireland to govern themselves"
bwr.12.t:0 "Gathering Support"
bwr.12.d:0 "With the revolution in full swing we need as many people on our side to join us against the upper class. We must gather support from all parts of the country, many workers are still on the fence about joining our cause. Many fearing our cause is over before it has even began, we must prove these people wrong! The longer we survive, more workers will join our cause."
bwr.12.a:0 "Onwards!"
bwr.13.t:0 "Police Stations Raided"
bwr.13.d:0 "In the early morning, many revolutionaries executed a plan to raid multiple police stations by storm - overwhelming the few constables posted there. By doing so the workers were able to retrieve plenty of small arms for their cause. These weapons will be distributed to the revolutionaries, in the hope it will give them a fighting chance against the British Army."
bwr.13.a:0 "Onwards!"
bwr.14.t:0 "Army Units Join Us"
bwr.14.d:0 "Many regiments, especially those raised in the north, have been hard pressed by their officers. Receiving harsh punishments for minor offenses.

bwr.14.a:0 "Onwards!"
bwr.15.t:0 "Rally Overseas Support"
bwr.15.d:0 "In order to survive we must gain support from nations overseas. Britain's rivals will be sure to help us if it means the United Kingdom is weaker. But we need the help, we can worry about this later. Let us hope their help is worth the trouble."

bwr.16.t:0 "Mutinies in the Navy"
bwr.16.d:0 "Many vessels in the Navy have been hard pressed by their officers. Receiving harsh punishments for minor offenses. Constant physical torture through the toughest of training. Being treated as a sub-human. Many of these sailors have had enough, with our encouragement they have risen against their snobbish officers to join our cause. With these ships now under our command, we no longer have to worry about a threat from the beaches."
bwr.16.a:0 "Hearts of Oak!"
bwr.17.t:0 "The Queen Flees London"
bwr.17.d:0 "Our revolutionaries in the London Area were unable to capture the Queen. By the time we captured Buckingham Palace, the Monarch and her family were already on a ship to Canada. This may not be an issue at the moment, but it will mean we won’t have any legitimacy when we win the revolution. The Royal family will likely seek revenge…"
bwr.17.a:0 "Too Slow…"
bwr.18.t:0 "The Queen Captured"
bwr.18.d:0 "When our revolutionaries stormed Buckingham Palace they found the Queen with most of her family in the process of trying to flee. However, they were too slow and our revolutionaries apprehended the monarch. This will be a major morale boost for our fighters and a blow to the Government. We will decide what to do with ‘her majesty’ later down the line…"
bwr.18.a:0 "Onwards!"
