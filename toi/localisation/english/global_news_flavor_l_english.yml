Bright and his expeditionary group of engineers and mechanics of the Atlantic Telegraph Company have successfully managed to lay a telegraphic cable along the seafloor of the Atlantic Ocean!\n\nUsing funding from both British and American governments, the cable was laid using decommissioned warships HMS Agamemnon and USS Niagara and stretches from Valentia Island in Ireland to Heart's Content in Newfoundland.\n\nThe line was inaugurated with congratulations exchanged between Queen Victoria and US President James Buchanan.

 worldnewsfl.61.d: "A violent explosion has been reported from the wast Siberian forests of Russia!\n\nThe cold winds of Siberia turned unexpectedly to smoldering fire in a flash over the taiga of Tunguska some days ago.

Despite the great power of the explosion, no impact crater or trace of the impact has been observed or found.\n\nThough the event has so far only claimed 3 lives, it has raised awareness of the question of meteor protection across the world and precautions are beginning to take place."
