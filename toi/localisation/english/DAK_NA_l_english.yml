 DAK_B_event.0.t: "Morning the States"
 DAK_B_event.0.d: "Three Deaths, that is all it took. Wilmot thought has he looked out the window, Three Deaths. It had been a week since the provisional legislature of the Dakota Territories had been forced to declare independence from the rapidly crumbling 'United States'.\n\nLess than a month since the collapse had started, all from petty squabbles in the far away capital. Wilmot sighed, this position was only ever supposed to be temporary. It had not even been recognised by the US government. An official appointment had been planned by DC, but now...\n\nWilmot glanced at the paperwork spread out on the rough surface of his desk. That was definitely not happening, not after a crisis that had destroyed the union. He picked up a report on the last raid from one of the Sioux tribes. It falls to me to hold the territory together, somehow.\nHow had it come to this?"
 DAK_B_event.0.a: "Dark times indeed"
 DAK_B_event.1.t: "A Divided Land"
 DAK_B_event.1.d: "Wilmot did not need to read the new report to understand its contents. The silence between his fellow statesmen in the [Root.GetAdj] Transitional Government and their somber expressions reflected all that was needed to know. \n\nThe Refugees of the Dakota War, fought between the Dakota Tribes of Minnesota and federal forces, had made west toward the land of their [SIX.GetAdj] brethren, rousing and radicalizing those with already hostile resentments against American Settlers.\n\nNow, with the might and authority of the federal government vacant from the Dakota Territory, the Sioux Tribes have become increasingly emboldened in their raids against the homesteads of our settlers these last few months. \n \nWilmots tiny forces, raised from the near unpopulated American settlements within the Dakotas could barely defend but a handful, let alone the massive border with the Sioux lands to the south.\n\nThe other members then turned to Wilmot, entrusting him to make the hard choice. \nOnly two options that could be done, both extreme. \nWilmot sighed, thinking for moment that stretched out like eternity. Finally, making a decision, Wilmot spoke."

 DAK_B_event.2.t: "Attempting a Meeting"
 DAK_B_event.2.d: "Wilmont looked through his notes again as the more friendly of the Dakotan elders entered the room. Clearing his throat Wilmont welcomes them in and offers them a seat. and begins the meeting,\n'To start off with, what do-'\n\nWilmont is cut off by the eldest among the leaders, 'What do we want? We want that which is owed, the money and rights that were promised to us and what YOUR government have reneged on again and again.'\n\n'That government is gone' Wilmont replied 'This new government offers integration.'\n\n'Integration? you think we want to be like you.' Cuts in another elder\n\n'No, i want to make a republic for both natives and Europeans, for all who call this land home.'\n\n'And we are to just believe this, after all the promises your people have made us were broken. After all the missed payments.'\n\n'And if we were to obtain those lost funds, would you join then.'\n\n'all of it?', the elders huddled together for a second, rapid words in Sioux flying back and forth. 'then that may bring the others to accept this deal.'\n\n'Then we will pay this price. On condition that you bring the others in to join us in building a republic.'\n\n'Then we await what is ours.' The Elders exit the room, leaving Wilmont to sit there and wonder where his little republic would get the funds from."
